                  After completing my post graduation in Computer Science, I have been worked many years as a computer teacher &#128522. 
                   After my arrival in Spain , I was confused about how to start my professional career here. So I decided to switch my career from teacher to web developer.
                   Having already an <b>IT</b> background , I have good knowledge of <b> CSS, Html, JavaScript</b> and other programming languages. I found the <b>Migracode</b> barcelona
                   platform, which helps me alot to develop my web developing skills and Github project management skills. Durnig the study in Migracode I have done many projects in Github.
                   Two of them , I posted below:
                 <div class="project">
